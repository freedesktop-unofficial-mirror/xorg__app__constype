constype prints on the standard output the Sun code for the type of
display that the specified device is.

It was originally written for SunOS, but has been ported to other 
SPARC OS'es and to Solaris on both SPARC & x86.

It has lived for years in the xc/programs/Xserver/hw/sun directory of
the X Window System, and is now split out by itself as part of the 
X.Org Modularization Project for X11R7.0.
